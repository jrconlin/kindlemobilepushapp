This directory should be added via Android Studio.

Go to
    ðŸ”½app
        ðŸ”½app
            ðŸ”½src/main   -> right click to bring up context menu: > New > Folder > Assets Folder

This will create an empty directory (which may not appear in the Project View)

Add the api_key.txt there.

(swearing optional, but theraputic.)

Make Sure to verify that the assets directory is present in the APK:

```
$ unzip -v *.apk
... Name
... ----
... AndroidManifest.xml
... META-INF/CERT.RSA
... [more files here]
... assets/api_key.txt
... [etc]
